## Heart Attack Possibilty
**IN PROGRESS**

For this case study, public sourced data was obtained from Kaggle. The table contained 14 attributes, including Target which is if the subject had a heart attack or not. Other attributes where: age, sex, chest pain type (4 values), resting blood pressure, serum cholestoral in mg/dl, fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2), maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy, and thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect.

The objective of this case study is to identify correlations between variables and prepare a model to predict a heart attack.
